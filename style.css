Freshops theme uses SCSS. You must have a preprocessor to compile the SCSS to make permanent changes to the theme.

Here are some excellent introductions to SCSS:

Here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with a pre-processor: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)

LESS App:

Compass App: (Windows / Mac Users)
http://compass.handlino.com/

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)
http://wearekiss.com/simpless

WinLESS: (Windows Users)

These applications compile LESS or Sass into valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production files easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.
