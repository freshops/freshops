<div id="variety_descriptions">Hops can be divided into two categories, aroma hops and bitter hops.</div>

<blockquote>
<strong>Aroma hops</strong> have a lower alpha acid percentage and an oil profile associated with good aroma. These hops are generally used as a finishing or conditioning hop.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<strong>Bitter hops</strong> have a higher alpha acid percentage. These hops are generally used in the boiling process to extract bitterness.
</blockquote>

Some varieties of hops are considered to have a dual-purpose, such as Northern Brewer which is both aromatic and bittering.  For a more detailed description of all US hop varieties go to <a href="/hops/usda-named-hop-variety-descriptions">USDA Hop Descriptions</a>.
