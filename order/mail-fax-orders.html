We are happy to accept orders by mail or fax. Follow the same steps as you would if ordering online so that shipping costs can be calculated by our automated shopping cart. 

When you arrive at the Freshops Secure Online Credit Card Orders Page, select the “Mail/Fax” payment method from the drop-down options. 

Follow the procedures from this point to create your invoice and send your order to us.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
