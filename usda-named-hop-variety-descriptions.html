USDA ACCESSION NO. : 19001 <a id="usda_id_19001" name="19001"></a>
SELECTION: Seedling selection made in 1919 at Wye College, England
GENUS: Humulus
SPECIES: lupulus
CULTIVAR: Brewer's Gold
PEDIGREE: Wild Manitoba BB1 x Open Pollinated (OP)
PRIMARY SITE: USDA World Hop Cultivar Collection, OSU East Farm
ORIGIN: Selected by E. S. Salmon at Wye College, England, in 1919. The mother plant BB1
was obtained in 1916 as a cutting from a wild hop growing at Morden, Manitoba. It was
believed to have been a genuine wild North American hop.
DATE RECEIVED: Before 1950
METHOD RECEIVED: Unknown, probably rhizomes
AVAILABILITY: No restrictions, commercial variety
REFERENCES: Salmon, E. S. Two new hops: Brewer's Favourite and
Brewer's Gold. J. South-East Agricultural College, Wye, Kent, England 34:93-105. 1934.

MATURITY: Late
LEAF COLOR: Light green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately resistant
Verticillium wilt: resistant
Viruses: infected with all five major hop viruses
VIGOR: Excellent, occasionally uneven spring regrowth
YIELD: High, 1500-2400 lbs/acre
SIDE ARM LENGTH: 24-36 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 9.2% (10 year range: 7.1 to 11.3%)
BETA ACIDS: 4.8% (10 year range: 3.3 to 6.1%)
COHUMULONE: 39 (10 year range: 36 - 45)
STORAGE STABILITY: Poor
OIL: 1.96 ml/100 g (10 year range: 1.38 to 3.42). Humulene 11.3% Caryophyllene 6.5%;

MAJOR TRAITS: Excellent yield potential, excellent pickability, heavy cone weight, good
parent for crossing.
OTHER INFORMATION: Identical to USDA 21116. This cultivar was a major hop variety,
particularly in Oregon until it was discontinued from commercial production in 1985 after
the advent of superalpha hops which had higher alpha-acids content and improved storage
stability. Brewer's Gold is the ancestor of most major high-alpha hops grown around the
world today (1997). It is still grown commercially in some parts of the world, notably
Belgium and Spain.

OTHER INFORMATION: L 16 is one of several Cluster selections grown commercilly in the
Yakima Valley, WA. Clusters are among the major hop cultivars grown in the United States,
having excellent storage stability, good yield potential and medium alpha acids content.
In recent years (1990s) Cluster acreage has declined in favor of super alpha hops, but
Clusters are still a major export hop for American growers. This hop is a sister selection
of L8 (USDA 65104), and Yakima Cluster (USDA 65102). All Cluster hops are interchangeable
in brewing and quality.

USDA ACCESSION NO.: 21014<a id="usda_id_21014" name="21014"></a>
SELECTION: Selected in the German Hallertau area, north of Munich,
probably from an old landrace about 100 years ago.
GENUS: Humulus
SPECIES: lupulus
CULTIVAR: Hallertauer mittelfrueher or Hallertauer mittelfrueh (m.f.)
PEDIGREE: Unknown
PRIMARY SITE: USDA World Hop Cultivar Collection, OSU East Farm, Corvallis
ORIGIN: Obtained from Dr. R.R. Romanko, SW Idaho Agricultural
Experiment Station, Parma, Idaho, who brought it to the
U.S. via Coors Brewing Company, Golden,Colorado, in the late1960's.
DATE RECEIVED: 1970; USDA Accession No. assigned in 1970.
METHOD RECEIVED: Rhizomes
AVAILABILITY: No restrictions, commercial variety
REFERENCES: USDA Annual Report on Hop Investigations for 1970, pp.11-12.

Hopfenverlag Wolnzach, Germany. 1975. p. 34.
MATURITY: Early
LEAF COLOR: Light green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately susceptible
Verticillium wilt: very susceptible
Viruses: unknown
VIGOR: Poor to good
YIELD: Low (about 800 lbs/acre)
SIDEARM LENGTH: 12 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 3-5%. ( 12 year range: 3.3 to 5.5%)
BETA ACIDS: 4.4%. (12 year range: 3.3 to 5.6%)
COHUMULONE: 20%
STORAGE STABILITY: Fair to poor (retained 55% of original alpha acids at 6
months room temperature storage)
OIL: 0.8 ml/100 g; Humulene 35.7%; caryophyllene 10.4%; myrcene 36.0% Farnesene trace; H/C
ratio = 3.42
MAJOR TRAITS: Highly aromatic. Valued worldwide for its noble aroma
characteristics as a fine finishing hop for super premium beers.
THER INFORMATION: Extreme susceptibility to Verticillium wilt and low yield
potential caused steady decline of this hop in the
Hallertau, the major German hop growing area. The old
Hallertauer mittelfruh has practically disappeared from
commercial production, but the trade has accepted a
relatively new selection, Hallertauer Gold, as a partial
substitute. Not grown commercially in the United States
except in a new planting (about 500 acres) of virusfree
Hallertauer m.f. near Bonners Ferry, ID. (Ref. A.
Haunold. Travel Report to Anheuser Busch Inc., July 1991, 4 pp.)

OTHER INFORMATIOIN: Tettnanger acreage has expanded significantly in the US in recent
years -called US Tettnanger (which however is not a true Tettnanger but similar to
Fuggle). German Tettnanger is grown primarily in the Tettnang area of SW Germany and on a
few acres in Switzerland across from lake Konstanz. This hop is thought to belong to the
Saaz group of varieties and it commands premium prices on world hop markets.

(USDA 21052), and a related selection,Aurora, (USDA 21053) entered the hop trade in the
1970's
as "Superstyrian" hops. The implication was that they be similar to Styrian
(Fuggle-type) hops but higher in alpha acids content. In reality they are Brewer's Gold
seedlings, and their quality characteristics are
different from the true Styrian (USDA 21049, Savinski Golding). This has caused
considerable confusion in the world hop trade. In recent years the acreage of
Superstyrians has been reduced in favor of the old
established Savinski (Styrian) Golding (21049). The acreage of Ahil in Slovenia has
remained very limited.

Slovenian aroma hop varieties and new breeding lines.
Talk presented to the 27th Congress of the European Union
of Hop Trade, Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, May 21-22 1979;
Proceedings printed in German and English.
MATURITY: Medium late to late
LEAF COLOR: Green to moderately light green
SEX: Female, but occasional sterile male flowers develop
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately resistant
Verticillium wilt: unknown, but probably resistant
Viruses: infected with Apple and Cherry strain of Prunus
Necrotic Ringspot virus, Hop Mosaic virus; shows
conspicuous yellow flecking on lower leaves
VIGOR: Fair to good
YIELD: Poor to good
SIDEARM LENGTH: 12-24 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 9-11%
BETA ACIDS: 4%
COHUMULONE: 36%
STORAGE STABILITY: Poor (retained about 50% of the original alpha acids
after 6 months room temperature storage)
OIL: 1.3-1.6 ml/100 g; ratio humulene/caryophyllene 1.8-2.1
MAJOR TRAITS: Moderately high alpha acids content
OTHER INFORMATION: This hop together with its sister selections Ahil (USDA
21050) and Apolon (USDA 21051) and a related selection, Aurora (21053),
entered the hop trade in the 1970's as Superstyrian hops. The implica
tion was that they be similar to Styrian (Fuggle-type) hops but higher in
alpha acids content. In reality they are Brewer's Gold seedlings, and their quality
characteristics are different from the true Styrian (USDA 21049, Savinski Golding). This
has caused considerable confusion in the
world hop trade. Of the three sister selections Atlas had the greatest expansion in the
late 1970's in Yugoslavia (over 400 acres). Acreage has since been reduced somewhat in
favor of the old established
Savinski (Styrian) Golding (USDA 21049).

Proceedings printed in German and English.
MATURITY: Medium early to medium late
LEAF COLOR: Green to moderately dark green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately resistant
Verticillium wilt: unknown, probably resistant or tolerant
Viruses: unknown
VIGOR: Good to very good
YIELD: Good to very good
SIDEARM LENGTH: 12-30 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 10-12%
BETA ACIDS: 4-5%
COHUMULONE: 22%
STORAGE STABILITY: Very good (retained 70-75% of original alpha acids after
6 weeks room temperature storage)
OIL: 1.1-1.8 ml/100 g; ratio humulene/caryophyllene 3.27
MAJOR TRAITS: High alpha acids content, European aroma, good storage stability.
OTHER INFORMATION: Similar in quality characteristics to Northern Brewer;
this hop achieved the largest acreage of all the four
Superstyrians (over 1000 acres) released in the early
1970's; Aurora, together with Ahil (USDA 21050), Apolon
(USDA 21051) and Atlas (USDA 21052) entered the hop trade
in the early 1970's as Superstyrian hop similar to
Styrian Golding (USDA 21049). All four, however, have
higher alpha and different aroma properties than Styrian
which led to confusion. Aurora seems to be the best of
the four in terms of yield potential and aroma. Acreage
has been reduced somewhat in recent years in favor of the
old established Savinski (Styrian) Golding (USDA 21049).

acids similar to European aroma hops; contains small
amounts of farnesene (about 4%), H/C ratio - 2.67; 10% humulene.
OTHER INFORMATION: Virtually identical to USDA 56013, except for slightly higher yield and
quality potential. Mostly grown in Washington where the alpha acids content
is often slightly lower than beta, resulting in an alpha/beta ratio below 1. Total 1991
production 2.54 mill. lbs. on 1240 acres, all in Washington; 1997 production 2.11 mill.
Lbs, all in Washington. Craft/microbrewers love this hop for its distinctive flavor.

SELECTION: Selected as a somatic mutation in a commercial field of
Talisman (USDA 65101)
GENUS: Humulus
SPECIES: lupulus
CULTIVAR: Pocket Talisman
PEDIGREE: Like Talisman (USDA 65101), some similarity to Cluster
PRIMARY SITE: USDA World Hop Cultivar Collection, OSU East Farm
ORIGIN: Selected by R.R. Romanko from a commercial field of
Talisman in Idaho in the early 1970's
DATE RECEIVED: Spring 1976
METHOD RECEIVED: Rhizomes
AVAILABILITY: No restrictions, publicly released variety

first edition 1973, pp. 29-30. Talisman-Tl.
MATURITY: Late
LEAF COLOR: Light green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: tolerant
Verticillium wilt: unknown, probably tolerant
Viruses: unknown
VIGOR: Good to poor
YIELD: Medium to poor
SIDEARM LENGTH: 12-24 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 6%
BETA ACIDS: 3.2%
COHUMULONE: 55%
STORAGE STABILITY: Good
OIL: 0.63 ml/100 g, H/C 1.09, very low in humulene (below 5%
of the oil), very high myrcene (65-70%)
MAJOR TRAITS: Substantially reduced internode length (about one half of
Talisman) and thought to be suitable as dwarf hop to be
grown on a low trellis. Ruffled, unattractive cone type
with very long tracts and bracteoles that are twisted
irregularly. Rhizomes have a large number of buds
(similar to crown gall infection in visual appearance)
but buds often fail to grow even under ideal conditions,
and therefore this hop is extremely difficult toestablish under field conditions.
OTHER INFORMATION: Originally thought to have exceptionally high yield potential (up to
3000 lbs/acre) which failed to materialize under commercial conditions. It takes up to 3
years to establish a yard since rhizomes often fail to grow. Alpha acids content generally
lower than that of Talisman (USDA 65101). This hop has never been grown commercially,
except for a 1-acre demonstration plot near Parma, ID in the 1970's where each hill was
4-strung and produced and excellent yield.

Late Cluster or Early Cluster.
OTHER INFORMATION: This hop, originally developed and released in South Africa, was
discontinued in that country in 1964 because of decreasing yields. The selection was
obtained from Cashmere, India in 1977, where it is still grown commercially. Like other
Clusters, Hybrid-2 is susceptible to Downy Mildew but infected crowns generally do not die
out in contrast to Cluster hops.

MAJOR TRAITS: tolerant to verticillium wilt; late maturity; produces
best yields when grown on a slant (Schraegaufzug) in Germany.
OTHER INFORMATION: Major German hop variety which has recently replaced Hallertauer
Mittelfrueh in world markets because of its resistance to verticillium wilt.
Various virusfree clones were developed in Germany in the 1980's which
supposedly had higher alpha acids potential (USDA 21514, 21515, 21516,
21517, 21518). All have a reddish stem similar to the original Hersbrucker, but
the alpha acids potential did not improve. Another Hersbrucker (USDA 21179,
Hersbrucker-E) was obtained in 1977 from the Hop Research Institute WyeCollege, England.
It is identical to the German Hersbrucker but more infected with viruses. International
brewers (such as Anheuser Kirin) who have readily accepted Hersbrucker as a replacement
for Hallertauer Mittelfrueh or other aroma hops are now reducing their purchases in favor
of new German aroma hops such as Hallertauer Tradition and Spalter Select which were
released in 1991. In 1997, total German production of Hersbrucker was 10.59 mill. Lbs on
7,670 acres, about 14 % of total German hop production.

MAJOR TRAITS: European aroma characteristics, high yield potential;
loose cones which shatter upon machine picking, especially when grown
seeded.
OTHER INFORMATION: Considered to be a high-alpha aroma hop; grown extensively in South
Africa where it is the major hop variety and also in India; several African countries
(Zimbabwe, Kenya) have experimented with this hop as a basis for their own hop industry
although these countries are probably too close to the equator (short day length) to grow
hops economically. Artificial extension of day length (100 watt bulbs spaced about 100 ft.
apart above the trellis) has drastically increased cone production in areas where natural
day length is too short. In 1978 about 1200 acres of Southern Brewer were grown
commercially in South Africa, some under supplemental illumination. Not grown commercially
in the United States.

SELECTION: Open pollinated seedling selection made by Professor E.R.
Salmon at Wye College, England, in the 1920's or early 1930s.
GENUS: Humulus
SPECIES: lupulus
CULTIVAR: Sunshine
PEDIGREE: Female OS99 x OP
OS99 arose from and open pollinated seed collected on the female B20, a
plant of unknown origin of the Golding class according to a letter from
Dr. R.A. Neve, head of the Dept. of Hop Research, Wye College, April 30,
1975. Neve says "Salmon conentrated very much on American seedlings and
the open pollination could easily have involved a wild American parent.
The oil chromatograms of Comet (USDA 62013) and Sunshine are similar."
PRIMARY SITE: USDA-ARS World Hop Cultivar Collection, Corvallis,

MATURITY: Medium-early to medium
LEAF COLOR: Lemon yellow, light green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately resistant
Verticillium wilt: unknown
Viruses: unkown
VIGOR: Fair to good
YIELD: Poor, 500-800 lbs/acre
SIDEARM LENGTH: 12-20 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 7.5% (3-year range 6.7-8.2%)
BETA ACIDS: 2.7% (3-year range 2.1-3.1%)
COHUMULONE: 34%
STORAGE STABILITY: Fair to poor (retained 50% of original alpha acids after
6-months room temperature storage
OIL: 1.35 ml/100 g; H/C - 0.19; humulene 0.9%, almost not
present at all; myrcene above 55% of the oil
MAJOR TRAITS: Lemon yellow leaf color, which persists throughout the
whole growing season. This seems to be a single gene since crosses
between yellow-leaved females and males segregate in the ratio 1:2:1
albino:yellow:green.
OTHER INFORMATION: This hop is an oddity because of its yellow leaf color and has value as
an ornamental. Open-pollinated seedling of Sunshine, USDA 19120, is the mother of Comet
(USDA 62013) from which Comet retained a slightly yellowish leaf coloring which is
conspicuous in early spring but disappears later during the growing season. Due to the
pale yellow leaf color of Sunshine the leaves often show necrotic burn in late summer due
to heavy sunlight exposure. A yellow-leaf type called Humulus lupulus var. aureus is sold
in the ornamental trade according to Gary Koller, Arnold Arboretum, Harvard University.

high-alpha hop.
MATURITY: medium late
LEAF COLOR: green
SEX: female
DISEASES: downy mildew: moderately sdusceptible
Verticillium wilt: moderately resistant
Viruses: latest tests in 1993 showed no presence of Prunus Necrotic
Ringspot and Apple Mosaic viruses,the so-called ILAR viruses, but
moderate infection with CARLA viruses (hop mosaic, hop latent
and American hop latent viruses) which did not appear to affect
Cone yields.
VIGOR: moderately vigorous
YIELD: medium to good, averaging 1,800 to 2,000 lbs/acre in Washington
test plots , but somewhat less in Oregon where downy mildew was
a problem.
SIDE-ARM LENGTH: 15 to 30 inches
ALPHA ACIDES: 13.6% on average (range: 10.2 to 16.5%)
BETA ACIDS: 6.3% (range: 4.6 to 9.0 %)
COHUMULONE: 19% (range: 17 to 22%)
STORAGE STABILITY: very good, retained 68 to 89% or original alpha acids after
6 months room temperature storage
OIL: range of 1.25 to 2.60 ml/100 g
60-70% myrcene; 8-10% humulene; 5-6% caryophyllene;
2% farnesene. Ratio of Humulene/caryophyllene = 1.5 to 1.7
MAJOR TRAITS: high alpha acids content coupled with very low cohumulone
content. This hop is a diploid, 2n = 20 and should be grown in
the absence of male hops to avoid seed production.
OTHER INFORMATION: This hop is being tested on a l imited acreage by a major brewer.
The low cohumulone content appears to be beneficial for foam
stability and pleasant "mouthfeel" as judged by professional taste
panels.
The mother of Horizon, USDA 65009, is also the mother of Nugget,
USDA 21193.

OTHER INFORMATION: This hop is a clonal selection of the old German landrace Hersbrucker,
but is thought to have slighly higher alpha acids potential. It is virtually identical to
USDA 21514, 21515, 21516, and 21518, except that the main stems seem to have a slightly
more reddish coloration, hence the name. There is no difference in brewing performance.
Hersburcker was planted extensively in Germany in the mid 1980s to replace the wilt
susceptible Hallertauer mittelfrueh. It has now (late 1990s) been largely replaced by
newer German aroma hops (Hallertauer Tradition and Spalter Select) which have higher alpha
acids potential.

OTHER INFORMATION: In older Cluster yards in the Grants Pass (OR) area and also in some
Yakima yards, Canadian RedVine was mixed in with Clusters. Canadian RedVine probably
originated in Canda (hence the name) and due to its extreme vigor and rhizome production
it spread rapidly. Farm workers were given orders to collect roots from an existing
Cluster field in preparation for new Cluster plantings and when they found a huge crown
(probably RedVine) that yielded several hundred roots (rhizomes) they could easily fill
their bucket from one crown which, sadly, was not Cluster.

Golding is different from Kent Golding, but chemically and in brewing, they are identical.
This hop has grown well in Oregon since its introduction in 1994, producing yields
substantially higher than those found in England. Microbrewers and Craft brewers in the US
are the major customers of Kent Golding.

Viruses: free of all major hop viruses at the time of release
VIGOR: very good
YIELD: good
SIDE ARM LENGTH: 12 to 30 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 4 to 5%
BETA ACIDS: 2.5%
COHUMULONE: 36%
STORAGE STABILITY: fair, similar to its female parent Saazer
OIL: 0.8 to 1.3 ml/100 g. Humulene 14%; caryophyllene 4%; farnesene 6%
Myrcene 56%; H/C ratio = 3.12. The oil is moderately high in humulene and farnesene.
MAJOR TRAITS: attractive lemon-yellow leaf color during the whole season., reddish brown
stem color which contrasts nicely with the yellow leaves.
OTHER INFORMATION: This is an ornamental diploid hop which is not intended for commercial
production. However, the cones could be suitable for flavoring beer and
ales especially of a Saazer-type aroma profile is desired. The reduced
chlorophyll content makes Sunbeam sensitive to direct sunlight in
midsummer, causing shriveling and browning of the leaves. Therefore,
this variety is best grown in semi-shaded areas to maintain attractive foliage
during the growing season.

and farnesene.
MAJOR TRAITS: lemon-yellow attractive leaf color during the whole season; reddish-brown
and sometimes even pink stem color which contrasts nicely to the yellow
leaves.
OTHER INFORMATION: This is an ornamental diploid hop, 2n= 20, which is not intended for
commercial production. However, the cones could be suitable for
flavoring beers and ales to impart a Saazer-type aroma profile. The
reduced chlorophyll content makes the leaves of Bianca susceptible to
leaf burn when plants are exposed to intense sunlight on hot summer days.
Therefore, this variety is best grown in semishadded locations to maintain
its attractive leaf color during the entire growing season.
Bianca is a half-sister of Sunbeam, USDA 21697.

MAJOR TRAITS: High yield potential in Yugoslavia but poorly adapted in
many other parts of the world; good aroma properties,
similar to established European "Noble Aroma" hops.
OTHER INFORMATION: Alpha acids content in the Backa Region of Yugoslavia has dropped
dramatically in recent years to as low a 1%. The hop trade is concerned. The reasons are
unknown but probably not due to viruses since spot tests by ELISA have revealed low virus
titers. This hop is probably identical to USDA 21080.

USDA ACCESSION NO.: 61021<a id="usda_id_61021" name="61021"></a>
SELECTION: Developed from a German land race in the Tettnang area
of southwestern Germany
GENUS: Humulus
SPECIES: lupulus
CULTIVAR: Tettnanger (sometimes called Swiss Tettnanger); other
names: Schwetzinger, Deutscher Fruehhopfen
PEDIGREE: Unknown
PRIMARY SITE: USDA-ARS World Hop Cultivar Collection, OSU East Farm, Corvallis
ORIGIN: Probably clonal selection; obtained in 1961 from S. S.
Steiner of Laupheim, Germany, via Parma Agricultural
Experiment Station, Idaho (Dr. R. R. Romanko)
DATE RECEIVED: 1961
METHOD RECEIVED: Rhizomes
AVAILABILITY: No restrictions, commercial variety

Various USDA Annual Reports starting in 1962.
MATURITY: Early
LEAF COLOR: Medium green
SEX: Female
DISEASES: Downy Mildew: moderately resistant
Verticillium Wilt: unknown
Viruses: unknown
VIGOR: Good, especially early in the season, but poor in early to mid-summer
YIELD: Low, 1000-1300 lbs/acre
SIDE ARM LENGTH: 12-36 inches
ALPHA ACIDS: 4.7% (9-year range 4.1-6.3%)
BETA ACIDS: 4.7% (9-year range 3.6-5.7%)

STORAGE STABILITY: Fair (retained 57% of original alpha acids after 6
months room temperature storage).
OIL: 0.66 ml/100 g (9-year range 0.42-1.13 ml/100 g)
MAJOR TRAITS: European noble aroma characteristics, alpha/beta ratio near 1; reddish hue
on the main vine.
OTHER INFORMATION: Imported to the United States in substantial quantities
because domestic production, which has increased in recent years, is
insufficient to satisfy demand. Exported from Germany to many countries
around the world for premium prices. German production is insufficient to
meet increasing demands worldwide. In 1988 2800 acres of Tettnangs were
grown primarily in northern Idaho, the Yakima Valley of Washington, and the
Willamette Valley of Oregon. (Note: This hop became known as US
Tettnanger and was originally a mixture with Fuggle. In recent years, most of
US Tettnanger was Fuggle. Anheuser Busch dropped US Tettnanger in
1997/98).The name Swiss Tettnanger refers to the fact that this hop clone was
originally brought to the U.S. from Switzerland (near St. Gallen across Lake
Constance from the major Tettnang hop growing area in Germany). It is very
similar to USDA 21015 which was introduced as a clonal selection in 1970.

This hop, also known under the trademark " Tomahawk" is believed to
be identical to the variety Columbus. Tomahawk is a trademark
registered by Yakima Chief Inc., but the hop is being marketed
under the F-10 designation.
According to Mr. Ralph Olsen of Hop Union Inc. it was officially
stated in a legal settlement reached with Mr. C.E. Zimmermann in 1998, that both Columbus
and Tomahawk are identical in all respects. (Personal communication to Dr. Al Haunold,
retired USDA hop geneticist at Oregon State University.
