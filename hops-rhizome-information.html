    Rhizomes' sizes are a function of age, maturity and cultivation. Rhizomes are selected on the basis of viable buds or potential new shoots. We use several criteria to carefully select and ship only viable rootstock.
    
    Regular rhizomes take at least 1 year to become established. The second year will produce a full crop.

    <h2>Quarantine restrictions</h2>
    Due to the detection of hop powdery mildew in 1997, a hop disease quarantine is in effect. The quarantine prevents shipping of hop plants to all of Washington State or internationally. We regret the inconvenience.
